### Exploring PySpark with an earthquake dataset from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 


#### After doing some courses on PySpark I decided to pick a dataset to get some unguided experience with PySpark. 

#### This project also includes a machine learning part with PySpark's MLlib and scikit-learn. The idea was to plot earthquakes by location on a map and cluster them. 

#### I compared the results of MLlib's K-means with euclidean distance to DBSCAN with haversine distance, which is more suitable for spherical shapes.
